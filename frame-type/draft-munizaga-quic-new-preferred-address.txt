1.  Introduction

   The QUIC transport protocol allows a client to migrate connections at
   any time to any new address (Section 9 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).  This
   allows the connection to survive changes to the client's address.
   QUIC also allows a server to migrate to a different address, but only
   a single time, and only to an address specified at the start of a
   connection via the Server's Preferred Address (Section 9.6 of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).  For some applications, including those where the
   server and client are peers, limiting the server to only a single
   migration at the beginning is too limiting.  This document specifies
   an extension to QUIC to allow a server to request a migration to a
   new preferred address.

   This document defines a new transport parameter that indicates
   support of this extension and specifies a new frame type to inform
   the client of the server's new preferred address.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Negotiating Extension Use

   new_preferred_address (0xff0969d85c):

   Clients advertise their support of this extension by sending the
   new_preffered_address (0xff0969d85c) transport parameter Section 7.4
   of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   Servers do not need to send this transport parameter.  Receiving this
   transport parameter signals to the server that the client understands
   the New Preferred Address frame.

5.  New Preferred Address Frame

   A server can use an NEW_PREFERRED_ADDRESS frame to request the client
   to migrate the connection to the provided server address.  Upon
   receiving an NEW_PREFERRED_ADDRESS, the client SHOULD initiate
   migration.  If the client does migrate it MUST adhere to the client
   behavior defined in Section 9.6 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT], with the
   modification of allowing a migration to a new server address mid-
   connection.

   The NEW_PREFERRED_ADDRESS is defined as follows:

   NEW_PREFERRED_ADDRESS Frame {
     Type (i) = 0x1d5845e2,
     IPv4 Address (32),
     IPv4 Port (16),
     IPv6 Address (128),
     IPv6 Port (16),
     Connection ID Length (8),
     Connection ID (..),
     Stateless Reset Token (128),
   }
